# COVID-19 SQL Project

SCENARIO: 
In this project, I decided to explore a COVID-19 dataset which can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) in SQL to learn more about the number of deaths caused by the virus and to learn more about the number of vaccinated individuals across the world. I asked myself questions that I felt were interesting such as: What percentage of the U.S. has gotten COVID? Which country has the highest infection rate? What is the death percentage in the U.S.? What is the death percentage globally? Which countries have the highest death count? What continent has the highest death count? How many people have been vaccinated by country? These were the type of questions that I asked myself to create queries to analyze the dataset to learn about the current situation of COVID-19 in 2022.  

My visualizations for this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brenden.lai/viz/CurrentCovid2022Dashboard/Dashboard1) which features a variety of different visualizations that were found through the queries
